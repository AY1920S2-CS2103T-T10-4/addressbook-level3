== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`ChatBox`, `ModuleListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `NasaBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::classDiagramModel.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* mainly consist of two components which are the `NasaBook` and `HistoryManager`.
* `NasaBook` contains all the user current stored modules and activities.
* `HistoryManager` contains all the user previous state for each of it actions.
* `NasaBook` contain a set of module list stored in `UniqueModuleList`.
* each `Module` consists of several `Activity`.
* an `Activity` can be either a `Deadline`, `Lesson`, `Event`.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save NASA data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nasa.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
`Contributed by:EdmondOng`

==== Implementation

For the undo/redo features, we aim to synchronize how the UI will look like and the data that is stored.
Hence, we created two Json files to store the internal data list and the filtered modules and activity list.
We uses Stack as the data structure for undo and redo features as it allows a Last In First Out effects, that suits
functionality of storing and getting data.

Below is a sequence diagram for undo feature.

image::undoSequenceDiagramV2.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire NASA book and state of UI.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Pros: Less repetition of opposite commands.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
** Cons: Maintain the actual looks for UI based on the filtered list.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
** Cons: Storing of the state of UI is still required.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a stack to store the history of NASA book states and UI state based on filtered list.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `Nasa internal list`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Add Deadlines, Lessons and Events Feature

Deadlines, lessons and events are to be added with their own commands. Refer to the user guide for the specific commands. Adding of activities is facilitated by ModelManager#addActivity.

==== Implementation
For any adding of activities, the command used will be the name of the activity. For instance, to add deadline, the command will be `deadline [paramters...]`.

The following activity diagram shows how a deadline (example) can be added. Lessons and events follow the same flow.

image::AddDeadlineActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Internal workings for the add activity command

Below is an example of a user adding a deadline and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters the command `deadline m/CS2030 a/Lab 2 d/12-12-2020 23:59`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create an AddDeadlineCommandParser which parses the input and returns an AddDeadlineCommand.

. LogicManager will execute the AddDeadlineCommand. AddDeadlineCommand will attempt to add the deadline to the specified module. If the module does not exist or the activity already exist in the list, then an error message will be thrown to the user. Else, add it to the module activity list.

. If the module's activity list is modified, the model will be updated and the view will be changed according to the new model.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram on what happens with the simple execution of the aforementioned command.

image::AddDeadlineLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

The design considerations for the classes are shown below:

[width="59%",cols="22%,<100%,<100%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Choice| Pros:|Cons:
|1.Placing all events, deadlines and lessons into one class called Activity|Easy and fast to implement. Very efficient and less dependencies|Bad design, and one class handles all three different logics.
|2.Having an abstract Activity class, and events, deadlines and lessons all inherit that abstract class|Somewhat easy to implement, polymorphism allows changing of one class without affecting the others.|Attributes can vary for different tasks. Hence additional code may be needed and even duplicated code due to similar logic.
|3.Same as 2, but now each attribute for activity has a separate class|Tedious to implement.|Without the classes for attributes, validating whether the attributes are legal needs to be done in the activity class which violates SRP design principle. But now each attribute has its own class with its own validation methods
|=======================================================================

=== Add Reminder Feature

Reminders can be added to activities so that the user can be notified when the activity is going to occur soon.

Below is an example of how users can add reminders:

. The user enters the reminder command: `reminder 2 m/CS2030 d/12-12-2020 14:50`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create AddReminderCommandParser that parses the input and returns a AddReminderCommand.

. LogicManager will then execute AddReminderCommand which will create a Reminder item that contains the Activity and the date to be reminded.

. The Reminder item will be added into the `ActiveRemindersList`. In addition, the reminders are sorted based on chronological order.

. The reminder list view will be updated to show the current `ActiveRemindersList`.

. If the time for any reminder has reached, there will be a pop-up or notification to alert the user for about 1min. And within 5 minutes, the reminder will automatically be removed from `ActiveRemindersList` and stored in the `PastRemindersList`.

For more information regarding the procedure, please refer to the Activity Diagram shown below.

image::AddReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

For more information regarding the structure of the feature, refer to the class diagram below:

image::AddReminderClassDiagram.png[]

=== Snooze Reminder Feature

Users can also snooze reminders so that they can get the same reminder at a different time.

Below is an example of how users can snooze reminders:

. The user enters the snooze reminder command: `snooze 2 d/12-12-2020 15:30`.

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create SnoozeReminderCommandParser to parse the input and return SnoozeReminderCommand

. LogicManager will execute the command and the Reminder that has just passed with the associated index on the `ActiveRemindersList` will have its due time updated. If time not specified, default is 5 minutes.

For more information regarding the procedure, please refer to the Activity Diagram below:

image::SnoozeReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

// tag::automation[]
=== Automation
`Contributed by:EdmondOng`

Every time a user stores an activity, start date for event will be recorded for `event` and due date for `deadline`.
Based on user input to repeat the task either weekly, twice weekly or monthly, our application will check whether today's date has passed
`due date` or `end date of event`. Once it passed,
the newly set date will be updated.

==== Implementation
By default there will not be any scheduling for any activities. Therefore, user has to enter `repeat-d` or `repeat-e` followed by
`INDEX` of the activity in the module list, followed by `module code`
,and set the activity to `0-Cancel, 1-Weekly-, 2-Twice Weekly, 3-Monthly`.

* An example of command line `repeat-d 1 m/CS3233 r/1`.

Once the command line is entered, our application will react in the following steps :

. NasaBook will search ModelManager for the module code `CS3233`.
. If present, it will search for the activity in the list with index `1`.
. Once identified, it will change the type of schedule to `weekly`.
. A success message `Successfully added a repeat! for CS3233 0 1` will be given.

image::sequenceDiagramAutomationV2.png[]

However, above is for the initialisation of schedule.
What happen if the activity has expired when NasaBook is not in use? Not to worry, because when
the user initialise the program again, the system will automatically reset the expired date.

This is how it goes :

. MainApp will execute initialisation which will fetch data through NasaBookStorage.
. NasaBook will load every module in the module list and update each activity in the module.
. If dateline of the activity has passed, it will check if it has a schedule
.. If scheduler sees `0` nothing will be done.
.. If scheduler sees `1`,`2` or `3` it will update to the new date.

image::activityDiagramAutomationV2.png[]
// end::automation[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Deadline Feature

Deadlines are sorted by a specific criteria, such as due date or priority.
By default, deadlines are sorted from top to bottom, date added from earliest to latest.

The list of sort criteria are as follows:

. Due date

. Lexicographical order

. Priority


Refer to the user guide for the specific commands. Sorting of deadlines is facilitated by
ModelManager#sortDeadlineList.

==== Implementation
To sort deadlines, the command will use the keyword `sort` followed by the sort criteria.

The following diagram shows how deadlines are sorted.

image::SortDeadlineDiagram.png[]

==== Internal workings for the sort deadline command

Below is an example of a user sorting deadlines by priority and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters the command `sort priority`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create an SortCommandParser which parses the input and returns an SortCommand.

. LogicManager will execute the SortCommand. SortCommand will sort all deadlines by the criteria specified.

. The underlying model's deadline lists are all updated.

. The view is updated to the new model.

. Subsequently, all CRUD operations will preserve the order specified by the latest sort command entered by the user.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram on what happens with the execution of the aforementioned command.

image::SortLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

The design considerations for the classes are shown below:

[width="59%",cols="22%,<100%,<100%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Choice|Pros|Cons
|Permanent modification on the model's deadline list when sorting.|Persistence of sorting ensure consistency
regardless of user input command. |Rigid design, user will have to explicitly enter the sort command and criteria to change
sort format.
|All CRUD operations on deadline list after sort criteria is defined will adhere to the sort criteria.|Consistency in
sort criteria is ensured, removing the need to enter the sort command after CRUD operations.|Can be expensive on
performance, and affect responsiveness of application when there are many entries of deadlines.
|=======================================================================
// end::sort[]

=== Statistics Feature (To be implemented)

Statistics on the status of activities based on a specific criteria such as time period is shown. By default, the
overall statistics for all activities are shown.

The list of criteria to be sorted are as follows:

. Overall

. Module

. Activity type

. Time (Weekly/Monthly/Yearly)

Refer to the user guide for the specific commands. Generating statistics is facilitated by
ModelManager#calculateStatistics.

==== Implementation
To generate statistics for activities, the command will use the keyword `statistics` followed by a specific criteria.

==== Internal workings for the statistics command

Below is an example of a user requesting for statistics by for the week and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters the command `statistics t/week`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create an StatisticsCommandParser which parses the input and returns an StatisticsCommand.

. LogicManager will execute the StatisticsCommand. StatisticsCommand will calculate the number of tasks and their
current status for each module over the past week.

. The view is switched to the statistics tab to display the overalls statistics for the week.


=== Chat bot Feature (To be implemented)

The CLI implementation is done through a chat bot like interface through a redesign of the user interface.

==== Implementation
The user interface is split into 2 sections where commands will be keyed into the chat box on the left side. Feedback
from the programme on the result of the command will be displayed directly by the chat bot where the command history
can be viewed. Changes made to the model will be updated in the user interface on the right side

==== Internal workings for the chat bot

Below is an example of a user requesting for statistics by for the week and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters a command `statistics`

. The NASA application will process the command. (Refer to section 3.8 for details)

. Command result generated by the logic manager is returned and displayed in the chat bot.

. User interface switches tabs to the statistics tab where the overall statistics are displayed.

// tag::quote[]
=== Motivational Quotes
`Contributed by: EdmondOng`
Given our hectic education lifestyle, we tend to neglect the emotional aspect of what makes life purposeful other than academic works.
This features randomly select a quote and displayed to user on start-up of application. It aims to lighten the mood of the user.

==== Implementation
On the first start-up of application, Nasa will store all the quotes inside a text file in the data folder. If the quotes file is
already present, it will carry on with selecting one of the quote to be displayed to the user. At any point of time, if you wish to see
another motivation quote, you can type `quote`.

==== Internal workings for the motivation quote.

. User enters a command `quote`.
. NASA will generate a random number and select a quote in quotes.txt file.
. Command result generated will be displayed to the user.
// end::quote[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Saving data

. Checking that NASA saves data properly

.. Copy `NASA.jar` to a new directory and open it. This is to simulate the scenario where the user has no data at all (ie no data file). Type in some commands and notice that the data file will be created for you. Verify that is it correct.

. Handling corrupted data

.. Edit the relevant `.json` files. Type in anything you want. And then close the NASA application. Restart it, the application will notice the corrupted data and will overwrite the data with a brand new one.
