== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelUML.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `HistoryManager` object that stores user's previous actions.
* it also stores the `NasaBook` data.
* `NasaBook` will contain a set of module list stored in `UniqueModuleList`.
* each `Module` consists of several `Activity`.
* an `Activity` can be either a `Deadline`, `Lesson`, `Event`.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Add Deadlines, Lessons and Events Feature

Deadlines, lessons and events are to be added with their own commands. Refer to the user guide for the specific commands. Adding of activities is facilitated by ModelManager#addActivity.

==== Implementation
For any adding of activities, the command used will be the name of the activity. For instance, to add deadline, the command will be `deadline [paramters...]`.

The following activity diagram shows how a deadline (example) can be added. Lessons and events follow the same flow.

image::AddDeadlineActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Internal workings for the add activity command

Below is an example of a user adding a deadline and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters the command `deadline m/CS2030 a/Lab 2 d/12-12-2020 23:59`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create an AddDeadlineCommandParser which parses the input and returns an AddDeadlineCommand.

. LogicManager will execute the AddDeadlineCommand. AddDeadlineCommand will attempt to add the deadline to the specified module. If the module does not exist or the activity already exist in the list, then an error message will be thrown to the user. Else, add it to the module activity list.

. If the module's activity list is modified, the model will be updated and the view will be changed according to the new model.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram on what happens with the simple execution of the aforementioned command.

image::AddDeadlineLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

The design considerations for the classes are shown below:

[width="59%",cols="22%,<100%,<100%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Choice| Pros:|Cons:
|1.Placing all events, deadlines and lessons into one class called Activity|Easy and fast to implement. Very efficient and less dependencies|Bad design, and one class handles all three different logics.
|2.Having an abstract Activity class, and events, deadlines and lessons all inherit that abstract class|Somewhat easy to implement, polymorphism allows changing of one class without affecting the others.|Attributes can vary for different tasks. Hence additional code may be needed and even duplicated code due to similar logic.
|3.Same as 2, but now each attribute for activity has a separate class|Tedious to implement.|Without the classes for attributes, validating whether the attributes are legal needs to be done in the activity class which violates SRP design principle. But now each attribute has its own class with its own validation methods
|=======================================================================

=== Add Reminder Feature

Reminders can be added to activities so that the user can be notified when the activity is going to occur soon.

Below is an example of how users can add reminders:

. The user enters the reminder command: `reminder 2 m/CS2030 d/12-12-2020 14:50`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create AddReminderCommandParser that parses the input and returns a AddReminderCommand.

. LogicManager will then execute AddReminderCommand which will create a Reminder item that contains the Activity and the date to be reminded.

. The Reminder item will be added into the `ActiveRemindersList`. In addition, the reminders are sorted based on chronological order.

. The reminder list view will be updated to show the current `ActiveRemindersList`.

. If the time for any reminder has reached, there will be a pop-up or notification to alert the user for about 1min. And within 5 minutes, the reminder will automatically be removed from `ActiveRemindersList` and stored in the `PastRemindersList`.

For more information regarding the procedure, please refer to the Activity Diagram shown below.

image::AddReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

=== Snooze Reminder Feature

Users can also snooze reminders so that they can get the same reminder at a different time.

Below is an example of how users can snooze reminders:

. The user enters the snooze reminder command: `snooze 2 d/12-12-2020 15:30`.

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create SnoozeReminderCommandParser to parse the input and return SnoozeReminderCommand

. LogicManager will execute the command and the Reminder that has just passed with the associated index on the `ActiveRemindersList` will have its due time updated. If time not specified, default is 5 minutes.

For more information regarding the procedure, please refer to the Activity Diagram below:

image::SnoozeReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Automation feature
==== Proposed Implementation

Each `Activity` will store a `Schedule` that contains it's date of creation and the next date
to refresh it implementation. By default, a `Activity` that is being created will not be set to repeat itself. A command `repeat m/CS3233 a/Programming r/1`
has to be provided. `r/` is the prefix identifier for setting the activity to repeat `r/1` weekly, `r/2` after twice
a week, `r/3` monthly.

Below is a given scenario on how this feature will works.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The application will fetch for existing data, if nothing was
initialise, user will have to add modules and activity into it. Let say, there is an existing module `CS3233` with
activity `Lab1` added on `20-03-2020 00:00`, by default, this activity will not be schedule unless `repeat` command is given.
To activate the scheduling, type `repeat m/CS3233 a/Lab1 r/3` into CLI.

Step 2: When the today's date passes `20-04-2020 00:00`, the application will trigger an update during initialisation to add another
cycle into it and hence the new date will be `20-05-2020 00:00` for it to refresh again. The activity `status` and `dateline`
will be reset automatically.

==== Design Consideration

* Alternative 1 (Current choice): Each activity will contain a schedule object.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Each activity will be cluttered with an additional object.

* Alternative 2 : Have a scheduler to manage all the activity.
** Pros: Neater.

=== Saving data

. Checking that NASA saves data properly

.. Copy `NASA.jar` to a new directory and open it. This is to simulate the scenario where the user has no data at all (ie no data file). Type in some commands and notice that the data file will be created for you. Verify that is it correct.

. Handling corrupted data

.. Edit the relevant `.json` files. Type in anything you want. And then close the NASA application. Restart it, the application will notice the corrupted data and will overwrite the data with a brand new one.
