== Introduction
Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for *busy university students to manage their module
assignments, lessons, exams and other miscellaneous activities.*

*While NASA has a user-centric Graphical User Interface, it is optimized for users who prefer to work with the
Command Line Interface (CLI).* If you can type fast, NASA can keep track of all your module activities faster than
traditional GUI applications.

Interested? Ready to blast off on an exciting student journey? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `NASA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all activities of each module
* **`add`**`m/CS2103T n/Software Engineering`: adds a module CS2103T `Software Engineering` to the list. Allows activities to be added to that module.
* **`deadline m/CS2103T d/20-02-2020 23:59 t/IP Project p/2 n/Must get an executable JAR file` : adds an activity called IP Project with the following details into CS2103T module activity-list.
* **`delete`**`1 m/CS2103T` : deletes the 1st activity shown in the module activity-list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `Madd m/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `Madd m/CS1231`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `[n/Notes]`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[m/MODULE_CODE]...` means m/CS2103T CS2101 .....
* Parameters can be in any order.
* Commands are **non case-sensitive**, unless stated otherwise.

** Events means any related module activities that happen from a time and ends at another time.
** Lessons are tutorials/classes for the modules and will auto reappear every week.
** Date format varies! For deadlines: `d/DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM`, for lessons and events: `sd/DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM - DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM ed/DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM - DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM` where sd/ is for start-time and ed/ is for end-time.
** Default priority is 1 (priority value is from 1 to 5, where 1 is highest priority and 5 is lowest).

Examples:

=== Locating activities by name: `find`

Finds activities whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `tutorial` will match `TUTORIAL`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Lab 3` will match `3 Lab`
* Only the taskname is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `tutorial` will not match `tutorials`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `tutorial lab` will return `tutorial 2`, `lab 3`
****

** Can only add `SHORTCUT` to an existing `COMMAND`.
** Can add multiple `SHORTCUT` for a specific `COMMAND`.
** A `SHORTCUT` will be generated that is unique for a `COMMAND`.

Examples:

** `shortcut s/l c/list` +
Adds a shortcut "l" to command list. "l" can now be used in place of list.

=== Generating statistics: `statistics`
Displays statistics of activities completed. +
Format: `statistics [tp/TIME_PERIOD] [m/MODULE_CODE]`

** Displays statistics on activities completed.
** By default, displays progression of all completed activities.

=== Automating activity: `repeat`
Allows user to repeat an activity from a module.
Format: `repeat m/MODULE_CODE a/ACTIVITY_NAME r/INDEX`

** `INDEX` can be in `1 for Weekly`, `2 twice Weekly`, `3 for Monthly`.
**  By default `INDEX` will be `0` hence no automation will be done.
**  The activity will be regenerated once user open the application.

Example :

** `quote` : “Limitations live only in our minds. But if we use our imaginations, our possibilities become limitless.” – Jamie Paolinetti

=== Undo: `undo`
Allows user to undo previous action.
Format: `undo`

Example :

** `undo` : "undo last action"

=== Redo: `redo`

Lexicographical order (non-case-sensitive): `name` +
Date added: `date` +
Priority: `priority`

Order by:

Ascending: `asc` +
 Lexicographically biggest, latest added, highest priority at the top of the module activity list.

Descending: `dsc` +

If order is not specified, ascending order is used

Examples:

** `sort sm/name ob/dsc` +
Sorts by non-case-sensitive, lexicographical order of the activity's name, in descending order.

** `sort sm/priority` +

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous NASA folder.

*Q*: Since every dateline is different how automation helps to keep track of my new dateline? +
*A*: The new dateline will be base on the interval when you first initialise the deadline activity. For example,
date of creating an activity is on 16-03-2020 00:00 and due date is on 20-03-2020 00:00. If you set repeat for a week,
the next due date will be 16 + 7 + 4 which is 27-03-2020 00:00.

*Q*: What is the purpose of an event? +
*A*: An event can be CCAs, bookings, etc.


=== Edit checklist item of activity
To edit checklist item, add the new checklist item with `chadd` before deleting the old checklist item with `chdel`.
=======
*Q*: How do I populate NASA with an activity (ie. Deadline, Event, Lesson) that occur regularly (eg. weekly)? +
*A*: Use the automate command (see section ‘Automation’)

*Q*: What are the differences between Deadline, Event and Lesson? +
*A*: All three activities are labels to describe the type of activity in a module. There are no functional differences between the 3 activities.

*Q*: How many modules can I add into NASA? +
*A*: NASA is optimised to display up to 10 modules at once - More than enough modules that a university student will typically take in a semester. Should you exceed 10 modules, please delete existing modules before adding new modules.

*Q*: How many activities can I add into each module? +
*A*: There is no limit, so add away!

*Q*: There is an unreported bug. What should I do? +
*A*: Please contact us here! We will respond as soon as possible.
