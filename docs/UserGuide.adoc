== Introduction

Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for *busy university students to manage their module assignments, lessons, exams and consultations etc*. More importantly, NASA is optimized for those who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. If you can type fast, NASA can keep track of your module tasks faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Time to take off!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `NASA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks of each module
* **`Madd`**`m/CS2103T n/Software Engineering`: adds a module CS2103T `Software Engineering` to the list. Allows tasks to be added to that module.
* **`Tadd`**`deadline m/CS2103T d/20-02-2020 23:59 t/IP Project p/2 n/Must get an executable JAR file` : adds a task called IP Project with the following details into CS2103T module task-list.
* **`delete`**`m/CS2103T 1` : deletes the 1st task shown in the module task-list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `Madd m/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `Madd m/CS1231`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `[n/Notes]`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[m/MODULE_CODE]...` means m/CS2103T CS2101 .....
* Parameters can be in any order.
* Commands are **non case-sensitive**, unless stated otherwise.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a module task-list: `Madd`

Adds a module task-list into the NASA application +
Format: `Madd m/MODULE_CODE n/MODULE_NAME`

Examples:

* `Madd m/CS2030 n/Programming Methodology II`
* `Madd m/CS1231 n/Discrete Structures in Mathematics`

=== Adding a task into a module task-list: `Tadd`
Adds a task into the specified module task-list +
Format: `Tadd TYPE_OF_TASK m/MODULE_CODE d/DATE t/TASKNAME [p/PRIORITY] [n/NOTES]`

** Type of tasks include `deadline`, `events` and `lessons`.
** Deadline are meant for tasks that need to be done within a certain time.
** Events means any related module activities that happen from a time and ends at another time.
** Lessons are tutorials/classes for the modules and will auto reappear every week.
** Date format varies! For deadlines: `DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM`, for lessons and events: `DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM - DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM`.
** Default priority is 1 (priority value is from 1 to 5, where 1 is highest priority and 5 is lowest).

Examples:

** Tadd lesson m/CS1020 d/12-02-2020 12:00 - 12-02-2020 14:00 t/Tutorial
** Tadd deadline m/CS1020 d/20-02-2020 23:59 t/Assignment 1 p/1 n/Watch lecture 3 and 4 before doing

=== Listing all tasks : `list`

Shows a list of tasks +
Format: `list [m/MODULE_CODE....]`

* If no module code is specified, all the module's task-list will be shown
* It is possible to add multiple module_codes and display all their relevant task-lists.

=== Editing a task : `edit`

Edits an existing task in the module's task-list. +
Format: `edit m/MODULE_CODE INDEX [d/DATE] [n/NOTES] [p/PRIORITY] [t/TASKNAME]`

****
* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX` in the specified `MODULE_CODE` task-list. The index refers to the index number shown in the module task-list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `edit m/CS2103T 2 d/12-12-2020 23:59` +
Edits the 2nd task in CS2013T task-list date to be `12-12-2020 23:59`.
* `edit m/CS2030 3 n/Finish LAB level 3 with Generics p/2` +
Edits the notes and priority of the 3rd task in CS2030 task-list to `Finish LAB level 3 with Generics` and `2` respectively.

=== Locating tasks by name: `find`

Finds tasks whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `tutorial` will match `TUTORIAL`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Lab 3` will match `3 Lab`
* Only the taskname is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `tutorial` will not match `tutorials`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `tutorial lab` will return `tutorial 2`, `lab 3`
****

Examples:

* `find tutorial` +
Returns `tutorial 1` and `tutorial 2` and any other tasks with name tutorial.

// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting a task : `delete`

Deletes the specified task from module task-list. +
Format: `delete m/MODULE_CODE INDEX...`

****
* Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX` in the specified `MODULE_CODE`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the task-list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* User can input multiple indices to be deleted.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete m/CS2030 2` +
Deletes the 2nd task in the CS2030 module task-list.
* `delete m/CS2030 2 3 4` +
