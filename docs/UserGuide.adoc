== Introduction

Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for *busy university students to manage their module
assignments, lessons, exams and consultations etc*. More importantly, NASA is optimized for those who *prefer to work
with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. If you can
type fast, NASA can keep track of your module activities faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the
<<Quick Start>> to get started. Time to take off!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `NASA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all activities of each module
* **`Madd`**`m/CS2103T n/Software Engineering`: adds a module CS2103T `Software Engineering` to the list. Allows activities to be added to that module.
* **`Tadd`**`deadline m/CS2103T d/20-02-2020 23:59 t/IP Project p/2 n/Must get an executable JAR file` : adds an activity called IP Project with the following details into CS2103T module activity-list.
* **`delete`**`m/CS2103T 1` : deletes the 1st activity shown in the module activity-list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `[n/Notes]`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[m/MODULE_CODE]...` means m/CS2103T CS2101 .....
* Parameters can be in any order.
* Commands are **non case-sensitive**, unless stated otherwise.
