== Introduction
Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for *busy university students to manage their module
assignments, lessons, exams and other miscellaneous activities.*

*NASA has a user-centric Graphical User Interface optimized for users who prefer to work with the
Command Line Interface (CLI).* If you can type fast, NASA can keep track of all your module activities faster than
traditional GUI applications.

Interested? Ready to blast off on an exciting student journey? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
.  Download the latest `NASA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].

Allows the user to see the activities onto a calendar.

* Switch to calendar tab using TAB key.
* Switch to calendar tab by clicking on the tab.

Examples:

image::calendar.png[width="300", align="middle"]

[TIP]
====
** Provides users with a great way to see what upcoming deadlines and events over the days, weeks or months.
** The calendar updates along with the activities being displayed. This means that if a user enters a `find` command and the activities that matches the keyword are only displayed on the module's tab. Then the calendar tab will also display the same few activities!
** This allows users to easily find their tasks and note down when is it going to happen or when is it due. Making it a more pleasant user experience!
====

=== Export Calendar: `calendar`
`Contributed by: kester-ng` +
Allows users to export the current calendar into an .ics format for other calendar applications +
Format: `calendar [p/FILE_PATH]`

====
** Exports the calendar into a .ics file named `nasa.ics` onto specified file path.
** If file path is not specified, the resulting .ics file can be found in the /data directory.
====

Examples:

** `calendar p/./nasa` +
exports the current calendar into nasa.ics file that is located at `./nasa` directory.

[NOTE]
====
** The export command will export all activities regardless of whether is it currently shown or not.
** Typing this command will cause all activities to be displayed!
** Deadlines are represented as a `VTODO` entry in the .ics file. And there are some calendars that do not support this (eg: Google calendar). Currently, deadlines will not be able to be displayed on such calendars. Will expand to support these types of calendars `[Coming in V2.0]`.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous NASA folder.

*Q*: What is the purpose of an event? +
*A*: An event can be CCAs, bookings, etc.

*Q*: How do I populate NASA with an activity (ie. Deadline, Event, Lesson) that occur regularly (eg. weekly)? +
*A*: Use the automate command (see section ‘Automation’)

*Q*: What are the differences between Deadline and Event? +
*A*: Both are describe the type of activity in a module. They are displayed in different parts of the NASA UI (ie. Deadline and Event panel, respectively)

*Q*: How many modules can I add into NASA? +
*A*: NASA is optimised to display up to 10 modules at once - More than enough modules that a university student will typically take in a semester. Should you exceed 10 modules, please delete existing modules before adding new modules.

*Q*: How many activities can I add into each module? +
*A*: There is no limit, so add away!

*Q*: Since every deadline is different how automation helps to keep track of my new deadline? +
*A*: The new deadline will be base on the interval when you first initialise the deadline activity. For example,
date of creating an activity is on 16-03-2020 00:00 and due date is on 20-03-2020 00:00. If you set repeat for a week,
the next due date will be 16 + 7 + 4 which is 27-03-2020 00:00.

*Q*: There is an unreported bug. What should I do? +
*A*: Please contact us here! We will respond as soon as possible.
