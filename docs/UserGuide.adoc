== Introduction
Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for *busy university students to manage their module
assignments, lessons, exams and other miscellaneous activities.*

*While NASA has a user-centric Graphical User Interface, it is optimized for users who prefer to work with the
Command Line Interface (CLI).* If you can type fast, NASA can keep track of all your module activities faster than
traditional GUI applications.

Interested? Ready to blast off on an exciting student journey? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
.  Download the latest `NASA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all activities of each module
* **`add`**`m/CS2103T n/Software Engineering`: adds a module CS2103T `Software Engineering` to the list. Allows activities to be added to that module.
* **`deadline m/CS2103T d/20-02-2020 23:59 t/IP Project p/2 n/Must get an executable JAR file` : adds an activity called IP Project with the following details into CS2103T module activity-list.
* **`delete`**`1 m/CS2103T` : deletes the 1st activity shown in the module activity-list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous NASA folder.

*Q*: What is the purpose of an event? +
*A*: An event can be CCAs, bookings, etc.

*Q*: How do I populate NASA with an activity (ie. Deadline, Event, Lesson) that occur regularly (eg. weekly)? +
*A*: Use the automate command (see section ‘Automation’)

*Q*: What are the differences between Deadline and Event? +
*A*: Both are describe the type of activity in a module. They are displayed in different parts of the NASA UI (ie. Deadline and Event panel, respectively)

*Q*: How many modules can I add into NASA? +
*A*: NASA is optimised to display up to 10 modules at once - More than enough modules that a university student will typically take in a semester. Should you exceed 10 modules, please delete existing modules before adding new modules.

*Q*: How many activities can I add into each module? +
*A*: There is no limit, so add away!

*Q*: Since every deadline is different how automation helps to keep track of my new deadline? +
*A*: The new deadline will be base on the interval when you first initialise the deadline activity. For example,
date of creating an activity is on 16-03-2020 00:00 and due date is on 20-03-2020 00:00. If you set repeat for a week,
the next due date will be 16 + 7 + 4 which is 27-03-2020 00:00.

*Q*: There is an unreported bug. What should I do? +
*A*: Please contact us here! We will respond as soon as possible.
