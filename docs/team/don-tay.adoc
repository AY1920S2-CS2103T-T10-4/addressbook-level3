== PROJECT: Nice and Amazing Student Assistant (NASA)

---

== Overview

Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for busy university students to manage their module
assignments, lessons, exams and consultations etc.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to export NasaBook via QR code*
** What it does: allows the user to export their deadlines and events via scanning QR code on NASA.
** Justification: This feature allows users to copy their deadlines and events to their phone by scanning the QR code given.
** Highlights: This enhancement builds on existing implementation of Deadline and Event, and utilises a 3rd party library to output QR code.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_
